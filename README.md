Question :  2325 from leet code Easy (decode the message)
You are given the strings key and message, which represent a cipher key and a secret message, respectively. 
The steps to decode message are as follows:

Use the first appearance of all 26 lowercase English letters in key as the order of the substitution table.
Align the substitution table with the regular English alphabet.
Each letter in message is then substituted using the table.
Spaces ' ' are transformed to themselves.
For example, given key = "happy boy" (actual key would have at least one instance of each letter in the alphabet), 
we have the partial substitution table of ('h' -> 'a', 'a' -> 'b', 'p' -> 'c', 'y' -> 'd', 'b' -> 'e', 'o' -> 'f').


Question :  2315 from leet code Easy (Count Asterisks)
You are given a string s, where every two consecutive vertical bars '|' are grouped into a pair. 
In other words, the 1st and 2nd '|' make a pair, the 3rd and 4th '|' make a pair, and so forth.

Return the number of '*' in s, excluding the '*' between each pair of '|'.
Note that each '|' will belong to exactly one pair.

Example 1:
Input: s = "l|*e*et|c**o|*de|"
Output: 2
Explanation: The considered characters are underlined: "l|*e*et|c**o|*de|".
The characters between the first and second '|' are excluded from the answer.
Also, the characters between the third and fourth '|' are excluded from the answer.
There are 2 asterisks considered. Therefore, we return 2.
